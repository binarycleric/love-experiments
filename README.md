# Experiments with LÖVE 

When I was a kid I wanted to be a game designer. That never happened so instead
I'm going to fool around with LÖVE and maybe make some entertaining stuff.

## Getting Started

Download LÖVE at http://love2d.org/#download.

Running my simple "games".

```bash
$ cd ~/src/love-experiments
$ love {{experement_name}}
```
